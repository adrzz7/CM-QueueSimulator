# Queue Simulator – Java Implementation

A simulation project that models a basic queuing system using Java. The system calculates metrics such as total wait time, average wait time, and queue length based on customer arrival and service times.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 📌 Key Features
- Simulates a single-server queue environment
- Accepts customizable arrival and service rates
- Calculates and outputs:
  - Total wait time
  - Average waiting time
  - Number of customers served
  - Time each customer spends in queue
- Outputs simulation results to the console

## 👥 Project Role
Individual project — handled end-to-end logic design, simulation modeling, and result analysis.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Simulation modeling
- Queue data structure
- Object-oriented programming
- Console-based program design

## 📁 Files
- `QueueSimulator.java`: Main simulation logic and result display
- `Customer.java`: Models customer attributes and arrival/service behavior

## 💡 Possible Extensions
- Add multi-server logic
- Visual interface or output to file
